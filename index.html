 <p><strong><font size="5"> Asid Freak, or <i>Just a Freak?</i></font></strong></br></br>

<i>TaeKasiD </i>, an Australian hip-hop artist in Perth, didn't understand the question nor how we could see him. He then continued to mold his silver-paper hat, straighten up his tutu and skip through the freeway. </br>
<font size="2">The search continues..</font></strong></br></br>

<strong><i>TaeKasiD's</i> music reflects a strange balance of dark lyrics and upbeat music. Thought to be a way to demean the lyrics and deny himself, he decided to clear things up.</strong></br>
"I know what I say and I know how it sounds to other people. It just doesn't sound that way to me, though. Honestly, its not uncommon for people to turn into a fucking psychiatrist to explain my traumatic denial in response to a funny story.
I'm a bit tropo, maybe, <i>but aren't we all?"</i></br></br>

<strong><i>TaeKasiD</i> made his debut in July 2021 and by August 2021 he had released an EP, an album and two singles.</strong>
</br>"A fair few songs were mastered the same day I began to write them. The album <i>On Asid</i> was around three days all up."
